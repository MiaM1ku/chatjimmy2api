Anti-Exploitation Public License (AEPL)

Version 1.0

Copyright (c) 2026 0x3st

The Anti-Exploitation Public License (AEPL) is dedicated solely to advocating
for the rights and dignity of workers. This License does not involve, endorse,
or oppose any political, economic, cultural, or other ideological positions
or disputes. Its sole purpose is to promote fair and humane treatment of labor.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Work"), to deal in
the Work without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,
copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of
the Work, and to permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so,
subject to the following conditions:

VIRAL APPLICATION

Once any Work incorporates this License, this License shall apply to that Work
in all its versions, forms, modifications, derivatives, conditions, and states,
without exception. Furthermore, if any component, module, plugin, library, or
other dependency of a Work is licensed under AEPL, the entire Work that
incorporates or utilizes such component must also carry this License and comply
with all its terms. This License is designed to have strong copyleft and viral
properties to ensure maximum protection for workers.

AUTO-UPGRADE

Within the same major version number (e.g., 1.0), this License shall
automatically apply the latest revision as published in the official AEPL
repository (https://github.com/AEPL-Project/AEPL-1.0). If the License text
carried within a Work differs from the current text in the official repository
under the same major version, the official repository version shall prevail and
be deemed the authoritative and binding version. This ensures that improvements,
clarifications, and updates to labor protections are immediately effective
across all AEPL-licensed Works.

However, this auto-upgrade mechanism does NOT apply across major version
boundaries. For example, a Work licensed under AEPL v1.0 will not automatically
become subject to AEPL v2.0. Upgrading to a new major version requires explicit
adoption by the Licensor.

DEFINITIONS

"Licensor" refers to the original author(s) of the Work.
"Licensee" refers to any individual or entity exercising rights under this
license.
"Worker" refers to any person contributing labor to the Licensee, including
full-time employees, part-time staff, independent contractors, gig workers,
interns, and outsourced personnel.
"Blocklist" refers to the publicly maintained list of exploitative entities
located at https://github.com/AEPL-Project/APEL-1.0/blob/main/blocklist.json.

ANTI-EXPLOITATION CONDITIONS

The above rights are strictly conditional upon the Licensee's adherence to the
following standards:

(a) The Licensee must strictly comply with all applicable labor laws in their
    jurisdiction. In jurisdictions with weak labor protections, the Licensee
    must adhere to the core conventions of the International Labour
    Organization (ILO).

(b) The Licensee shall not use the Work to create systems that:
    (i)   Monitor Workers' non-work activities or private communications;
    (ii)  Enforce algorithmic management that disregards Workers' physical or
          mental safety;
    (iii) Penalize Workers for exercising their "Right to Disconnect" outside
          of agreed working hours.

(c) If the Licensee uses the Work to develop Artificial Intelligence systems
    intended to automate tasks currently performed by Workers, the Licensee
    must provide affected Workers with a transition plan, including retraining
    or fair severance compensation.

(d) The Licensee guarantees that no part of their direct supply chain involves
    forced labor or child labor.

BLOCKLIST TERMINATION

If the Licensee (or its parent company, subsidiaries, or majority-owned
affiliates) is listed on the Blocklist with an "ACTIVE" status, all rights
granted under this License are automatically and immediately terminated. There
is no option to purchase a separate commercial license to bypass this
termination. Violation of human rights cannot be offset by monetary payment.
